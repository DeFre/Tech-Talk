# Tech-Talk Presentation checklist

**Just a quick checklist to go over, before you give a presentation. It's based on the feedback given afterwards. It does assume you actually created a presentation, so "did you create slides" is not on there.**

## Did you...
[ ] Add your own name?
[ ] Number your slides?

## Make sure to be
[ ] On time (so you are ready to start)
[ ] Stay within time (not too long, but not too short either)
